Welcome to this collection of pages that I call a website. There isn't much here right now except for a [links page](/links.html).

This site is to be a collection of resources that I find useful and that I hope can be useful for others.

### Links to my stuff
I have a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Alex-Addy), on which I have several projects in varying degrees of incompleteness. A summary of the projects can be found on my [projects page](/projects.html).
